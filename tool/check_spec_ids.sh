# Traceability gate between the QA spec and the test suite.

# Every case the spec marks [A] (automated) must exist as a test whose name
# carries the spec ID — so a claimed-but-missing test fails the build instead
# of surviving until a human audit (that is exactly how NAV-05 and TTS-13
# shipped falsely marked [A] once). Extend the list whenever the spec
# promotes a case to [A].
