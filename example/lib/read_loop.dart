/// Speaking one reading unit, at a speed the reader may change halfway.
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// **Neither Android TTS nor iOS can change the rate of an utterance that is
/// already being spoken.** `setSpeechRate` applies to the *next* thing you
/// speak. The book hands the engine one unit at a time, so "the next thing"
/// used to mean "the next paragraph" — and in a long paragraph a reader taps
/// a speed button and nothing happens for half a minute. Correct, and it
/// feels broken.
///
/// The only lever is to stop and speak again. This loop does that at the
/// **last word boundary the engine reported**, so the reader hears a short
/// seam and then the same sentence carrying on faster or slower, rather than
/// the paragraph starting over.
///
/// The book never sees any of it: one `onRead` call, one future, completed
/// when the unit is genuinely finished. The read marker does not move.
///
/// # The engine that cannot keep up
///
/// Some engines report no word progress at all (certain Samsung builds).
/// There the boundary stays where the last restart put it, so a speed change
/// repeats from there — the same honest fallback pause/resume already has.
